When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
   I may want to use a remote repository for back up or when I want to collaborate with someone.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
   because i need to choose which changes I want to pull

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	fork - cloning a repository from a github repo to another github repp

	clone - cloning from a github repo/local repo to another local repo

	branches - branching from local repo

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	to have a clean copy before other collaborators made changes with the code

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	by creating branches, remote repositories, forks, pull request
